## üß± Dependencies and Setup
### üß∞ Dependencies
- torch `1.11.0`
- geoopt `0.1.0` 
- dgl `1.0.0` 
- other required packages in `requirements.txt`

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup
```bash
# git clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/MananSuri27/CoSyn
cd CoSyn

# install python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
We will need to move the code for Hyperbolic Graph Comvolution `models/hgconv.py` to the `dgl` library.
```bash
mv CoSyn/models/hgconv.py path-to-dgl/dgl/python/dgl/nn/pytorch/conv/
```
and correspondingly update the export statememt at `path-to-dgl/dgl/python/dgl/nn/pytorch/conv/__init__.py /`.


## üîå Dataset Processing
### üí¨ Conversation Trees
**Required Files:**
- Node and edge features stored in `members` and `interactions` directory for each split `train`, `dev`, `test`. For each conversation tree, corresponding to a given parent node id `tweet_id`, there will be a `members/tweet_id.csv` and `interactions/tweet_id.csv` having the node features and edge list respectively.
- A file, `username2id.csv` which maps usernames to an id between [0,n) where n is number of users.
- Post embeddings for each post saved in the `embeds` directory.

**To generate the conversation trees and load them as a pickle file, run the following code:**
```bash
python3 utils/graphs.py
```

### üåê Social Graph

**Required Files:**
- User relation matrices stored as `[test/train/val]/matrix/file`, where multiple files can exist in each split, and each file is an adjacency list representation of edges between given users.
- Post embeddings of the last m(=100 in our paper) posts posted by the user in `embeds` directory, referenced by user ID.
- A file, `username2id.csv` which maps usernames to an id between [0,n) where n is number of users.

**To generate the conversation trees and load them as a pickle file, run the following code:**
```bash
python3 utils/socialgraph.py
```

## üèãÔ∏è Training
To run the training script, run the following code:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
